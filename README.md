## 🧠 Project Overview

**C Web Music Player** is a modern, cyber‑style music player that uses **C language as the core backend logic engine**.  
Unlike traditional projects where C is limited to console programs, this project demonstrates how **low‑level C concepts can power real‑time, interactive web systems** when combined with modern technologies.

The browser handles audio playback, while **all playlist logic, memory handling, and decision‑making are implemented in C**.

---

## 🚀 Why This Project Is Unique

- ✅ Uses **C as the brain of the system**
- ✅ Demonstrates **dynamic memory allocation in real use**
- ✅ Implements **file handling for persistent storage**
- ✅ Combines **low‑level logic with modern web UI**
- ✅ Built with **academic + portfolio focus**

## 🏗️ System Architecture

User (Browser UI & Audio)
↓
Python (Flask Bridge)
↓
C Backend Engine
↓
Dynamic Memory + File System


- **Frontend** → User interface & audio playback  
- **Python (Flask)** → Communication bridge  
- **C Backend** → Core logic & data management  

---

## 🎵 Key Features

- Multi‑song playlist support  
- Next / Previous navigation  
- Shuffle mode (random logic)  
- Repeat modes (none / one / all)  
- Song search functionality  
- Delete song (array shifting logic)  
- Persistent storage using files  

---

## 🧠 Role of C Backend

The C backend is responsible for:

- Managing playlists using **structures**
- Storing songs in **dynamic arrays**
- Handling navigation using **indexes**
- Implementing shuffle using `rand()`
- Persisting data using **file handling**
- Managing memory using `malloc()`, `realloc()`, and `free()`

This makes the project a **complete practical demonstration of core C concepts**.
