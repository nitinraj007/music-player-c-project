## 🧠 Project Overview

**C Web Music Player** is a modern, cyber‑style music player that uses **C language as the core backend logic engine**.  
Unlike traditional projects where C is limited to console programs, this project demonstrates how **low‑level C concepts can power real‑time, interactive web systems** when combined with modern technologies.

The browser handles audio playback, while **all playlist logic, memory handling, and decision‑making are implemented in C**.

---

## 🚀 Why This Project Is Unique

- ✅ Uses **C as the brain of the system**
- ✅ Demonstrates **dynamic memory allocation in real use**
- ✅ Implements **file handling for persistent storage**
- ✅ Combines **low‑level logic with modern web UI**
- ✅ Built with **academic + portfolio focus**

## 🎵 Key Features

- Multi‑song playlist support  
- Next / Previous navigation  
- Shuffle mode (random logic)  
- Repeat modes (none / one / all)  
- Song search functionality  
- Delete song (array shifting logic)  
- Persistent storage using files

🔧 Core C Backend Engine
The C backend acts as the logic engine of the music player.
While the browser handles audio playback, all decision‑making and data management happen in C, making this project a strong demonstration of system‑level programming.

What the C backend handles
🧱 Playlist Modeling
Uses structures to represent songs and playlists in a clean, scalable way.

📦 Dynamic Song Storage
Stores songs in dynamically allocated arrays, allowing the playlist to grow at runtime.

🧭 Playback Navigation Logic
Manages current track indexing, next/previous traversal, and boundary conditions.

🎲 Shuffle Algorithm
Implements randomized playback using rand() with safe index control.

💾 Persistent Data Layer
Reads and writes song data using file handling, ensuring data is retained across runs.

🧠 Manual Memory Management
Allocates, resizes, and releases memory using malloc(), realloc(), and free() — demonstrating low‑level control.

This backend design turns traditional C concepts into a real‑world, interactive system, rather than a console‑only program.
